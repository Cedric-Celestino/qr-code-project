## My Process

### Built With
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I Learned
Through this project, I learned the importance of a **mobile-first approach** in web design. While I initially coded with mobile dimensions in mind, I found myself prioritizing desktop layouts. This experience helped me understand why starting with mobile ensures a more accessible, responsive, and user-friendly design.

Here is an example of the mobile-specific CSS I used:

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 200px){
  .card {
      max-width: 18rem;
      min-height: 28rem;
      padding: 5%;
  }

  .qr-image {
      max-width: 18rem;
      width: 100%;
      object-fit: contain;
  }

  .title {
      font-size: 1.1rem;
      margin-inline-start: 1.2em;
      margin-inline-end: 1.2em;
  }

  .description {
      font-size: 0.9rem;
      margin-inline-start: 1.2em;
      margin-inline-end: 1.2em;
  }

  .attribution {
      font-size: 1rem;
      padding: 0 3%;
  }
}
```

### Continued Development

I want to improve my skills in **layout positioning** and **container dimensions**. Choosing the right colors for a project is also something I aim to master as I continue my learning journey.
